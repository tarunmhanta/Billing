🧾 Rudra Electronics - Billing System


A comprehensive, web-based billing system designed for Rudra Electronics and Accessories. It allows for creating, saving, fetching, and exporting invoices, all powered by a Google Sheets backend.

This system is built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the frontend, and uses Google Apps Script to connect to a Google Sheet, which acts as a free, multi-user database.

(Note: You should replace this with a screenshot of your own project!)
